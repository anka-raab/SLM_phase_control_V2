# SLM_phase_control
A small GUI application for controlling the phase of the SLM.

To run the program, execute "controlPhaseSLM.py", it wil load all the other files as it needs to.

Some settings (the wavelength used in the lab and the SLM type used) still need to be made on the code level before the program is run.
These can be found and changed in the file "settings.py".



### Updates

This project is currently being updated to work with the Santec SLM-300.
